            <h2>Hello.</h2>
              <p class="intro">My name is Cameron Morris and I work as a Research & Development Engineer at OMG Inc.
                  I graduated with a degree in Mechanical Engineering from Western New England University and currently
                pursuing a Master's in Mechatronics there.
                  I'm also working towards my pilots license in a Cessna 172
                with VFR rating.
                  I enjoy photography, hiking, kayaking, gaming, crafting and adventuring in my free time.</p>

                <h3>Computer Programs</h3>
                <p>Throughout my career as a student and engineer I've gained experience using computer
                    programs such as SolidWorks, Siemens NX, LabVIEW, and Minitab. I am also proficient in
                    using the Microsoft Office programs to document, present and report.</p>

                <h3>Coding</h3>
                <p>I have also learned coding languages such as C/C++, Python and now ROS in applications
                    such as measurement systems, motor control, and mobile robotics. I am also exploring the
                    use of vision systems to improve quality measurements and documentation.</p>

                <h3>Photography</h3>
                <p>One of my favorite hobbies is photography. I am a self-taught photographer with 8 years
                    of experience starting with a Canon EOS Rebel T6. Since then, I have used the Canon 90D
                    and now the Canon R7 Mirrorless camera. I specialize in aviation photography but also enjoy
                    landscape, portrait and action photography
